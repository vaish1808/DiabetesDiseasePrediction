# Diabetes Disease Prediction
## Introduction
Diasense is a website that not only predicts risk associated with the diabetes but also offers vital information on diabetes such as its
types, symptoms, causes, recommended exercises, and dietary advice thus serving as an informative and diagnostic
platform.

## Dataset
I gathered the dataset from Kaggle, link for the same is https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database. This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The datasets consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable, Outcome. Predictor variables includes the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on.

### Required Libraries
The libraries required for this project are:<br>
• Numpy (to perform logical/mathematical operations on arrays/matrices)<br>
• Pandas (data analysis & manipulation)<br>
• sklearn (Machine learning library).

#### Preprocessing the dataset
• Check for missing data : As sometimes if values are missing it might create error while training model. <br>
• Co-relation matrix : used to find co-relation b/w various columns. <br>
• Heat map : Since results of co-relation are not that clear so to visualise it in better manner we plot heat map....darker the color, least is the co-relation, outcome least dependent on bp & most on glucose. <br>
• Training &amp; testing model : Created 2 variables X (independent columns) &amp; Y(Dependent column). 80% data training &amp; 20% data
testing. <br>
• To increase accuracy : use different train to test ratio, normalize data
&amp; change classifier.

Tech Stack: HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python, Django, Machine Learning
